# P2_SCAV_BlancaCervera

In this second lab we are going to divide the main script in 4 different exercises.

# Exercise 1
Creating a script which can cut N seconds the BBB video (in the example I put I cut 12 seconds). We must create this with user interaction.

# Exercise 2
Creating a script which will extract the YUV histogram from the previous BBB video we have created and combining both images at the same time.

# Exercise 3
Creating a script which can resize the BBB video into 4 differents video outputs 
1 - 720p
2 - 480p
3 - 360x240
4 - 160x120

# Exercise 4
Creating a script which can change the audio into mono output and then change this mono output into a different audio codec.
